This is an online store scraper. It is used to scrape the data from online stores and display it in an easy to read
format.

To start out it will only scrape the data from the [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) website.

In the future it will be able to scrape data from other online stores as well.

Currently working on: getting views to diplay in correct format. right now the HTML is being displayed as a string.
